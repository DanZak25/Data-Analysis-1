# Data-Analysis-1

## Purpose
1. To study the metrics that influence midfielder's assists numbers
2.To classify midfielders into roles using ML and study the distribution

The dataset used in this study consists of football player statistics from the 2021-2022 season. It includes performance metrics such as passes completed(PasTotCmp),Interceptions(Int), completed passes into the 18-yard box(PPA) and more. In addition, it also contains player's details such as minutes played(Min), squad, league(Comp) and more. The dataset covers players across the top five European leagues: Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1.

This project focuses on the performance of midfielders across these five leagues. To ensure precise analysis, only midfielders who played a total of **1500 minutes played and above** were extracted for further analysis. The features have also been streamlined to only about 30 features from 120 features to remove any redundancies of features.

**Notice:** All performance metrics(features) values that are not in percentage, are recorded in per 90s(Minutes played/90 minutes) unit.
